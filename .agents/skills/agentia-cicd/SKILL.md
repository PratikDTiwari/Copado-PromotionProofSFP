description: Use this skill when managing Copado CICD work with the Agentia CLI or Agentia MCP tools: user stories, cloud commit/promote, work publish/submit/done, promotion runs and conflicts, job executions, environments, credentials, pipelines, stages, and release data templates. Use it whenever the user asks an agent to operate Copado CICD from a terminal, IDE, or headless workflow.

# Agentia CICD

Use this skill to operate Copado CICD through Agentia without guessing command order, IDs, or JSON fields.

Prefer Agentia MCP tools when they are available and match the task. Use CLI examples as the fallback, and add `--json` whenever the result will be parsed or reused.

## Start Here

1. Confirm `agentia auth get --cicd --json` is configured, or that the current process supplies `AGENTIA_CICD_API_KEY` and `AGENTIA_CICD_BASE_URL`.
2. Identify the domain below and read only the matching reference file.
3. Before mutating data, read the target record first with the matching `get`, `list`, or `status` command.
4. Never print credentials, PATs, OAuth signatures, or unmasked environment variables.

## General Rules

- Use Salesforce record IDs or generated names read from Copado. Do not invent story names, promotion IDs, job IDs, credential IDs, or pipeline IDs.
- Keep human output off stdout in JSON workflows. Prefer `--json`, then parse the result object.
- For local project work, keep the tracked working tree clean before commands that require it: `work set`, `work publish`, and `work submit`. If `work set` returns `status: "warning"`, show the message and do not assume a feature branch was created; branch keys are cleared and the work item id/name/title are still recorded in config.user.json.
- Treat `cicd job` as Copado CICD JobExecution. It is different from CRT `testing job`.
- Treat `cicd work test` as local quality gates (`--local` is the default). It is different from CRT `testing test run`.
- Treat `cicd work test apex` as the Apex test runner that local quality gates (`.agentia_quality_gates.*`) usually call when those scripts are configured. It can also be invoked directly. It is different from CRT.
- Treat `auth` credentials as keychain/API credentials and `cicd credential` records as Copado environment credentials.

## Report Back

When you finish a CICD operation, report the command path used, target IDs or names, final status, whether JSON was used, and any remaining manual action. Do not include secrets.
